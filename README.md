# A-machine-learning-algorithm-that-can-accurately-predict-and-prevent-cyber-attacks
The machine learning algorithm is designed to analyze network traffic and identify patterns that indicate a potential cyber attack. It uses supervised machine learning techniques to learn from a large dataset of known cyber attacks, including malware infections, phishing attempts, and denial-of-service attacks
