The machine learning algorithm is designed to analyze network traffic and identify patterns that indicate a potential cyber attack. It uses supervised machine learning techniques to learn from a large dataset of known cyber attacks, including malware infections, phishing attempts, and denial-of-service attacks.
Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be deployed in a real-world network environment to monitor network traffic in real-time. As network traffic flows through the system, the algorithm analyzes the data and looks for patterns that match known cyber attack patterns.
If the algorithm detects a potential cyber attack, it takes proactive measures to prevent the attack from occurring. For example, it could block suspicious IP addresses, quarantine infected devices, or alert network administrators to take further action.
To ensure the algorithm remains effective over time, it is regularly updated with new data on emerging cyber threats. This allows it to adapt to new attack patterns and continue to accurately predict and prevent cyber attacks.
